# Corruption-Profiler
This is a project for my Master's Degree. The objective is to profile congressman expenses and detect anomalies that could lead to a case of corruption.

The scripts used for this project are based on [Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor), a project developed by [Datascience Brigade](https://datasciencebr.com/) with a similar goal.

### Upcomimg changes

1. Apply interquartile distance to find expense with the most information
1. Change classifier to random forest to better gather rules from results
1. Measure classifier accuracy on each cluster for better estimation.
