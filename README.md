# Corruption-Profiler
This is a project for my Master's Degree. The objective is to profile congressman expenses and detect anomalies that could lead to a case of corruption.

The scripts used for this project are based on [Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor), a project developed by [Datascience Brigade](https://datasciencebr.com/) with a similar goal.
